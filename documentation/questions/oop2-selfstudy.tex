\subsection{Exercises from book (chapter 2)}
\subsubsection{Exercise 2.1}
Create a \verb?TicketMachine? object bench and take a look at its methods. You 
should see the following: \verb?get Balance, getPrice, insertMoney,? and 
\verb?ptintTicket?. Try out the \verb?getPrice? method. You should see a 
return value containing the price of the ticket thet was set when this object 
was created. Use the \verb?insertMoney? method to simulate inserting an amount 
of money into the machine. The machine stores as a balance the amount of money 
inserted. Use \verb?getBalance? to check that the machine has kept an accurate 
record of the amount just inserted. You can insert several seperate amounts of 
money into the machine, just like you might insert multiple coins or bills into 
a real machine. Try inserting the exact amount required for a ticket, and use 
\verb?getBalance? to ensure that the balance is increased correctly. As this is 
a simple machine, a ticket will not be issued automatically, so once you have 
inserted enough money, call the \verb?printTicket? method. A facsimile ticket 
should be printed in the BlueJ terminal window

\subsubsection{Exercise 2.2}
What value is returned if you get the machine's balance after it has printed a 
ticket? 

\subsubsection{Exercise 2.3}
Experiment with inserting different amounts of money before printing tickets. 
Do you notice anything strange about the machine's behavior? what happens if 
you insert too much money into the machine - do you receive any refund? what 
happens if you do not insert enough and then try to print a ticket? 

\subsubsection{Exercise 2.4}
Try to obtain a good understanding of the ticket machine's behavior by 
interacting with it on the object bench before we start looking, in the next 
section, at how the \verb?TicketMachine? class is implemented. 

\subsubsection{Exercise 2.5}
Create another ticket machine for tickets of a different price; remember that 
you have to supply this value when you create the machine object. Buy a ticket 
from that machine. Does the printed ticket look any different from those 
printed by the first machine? 

\subsubsection{Exercise 2.6}
Write out what you think the outer wrappers of the \verb?Student? and 
\verb?LabClass? classes look like; do not worry about the inner part.
