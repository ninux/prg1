\subsubsection*{Exercise 7}
\textit{The following method shall be called with a actual parameter.
Durign the execution the maximum height of the call-stack is 5.
So how many times was the method coolMethod() called?} \\

\begin{lstlisting}
public int coolMethod(int n)
{
	if(n >= 2){
		return (coolMehtod(n-1) + coolMethod(n-2));
	} 
	else{
		return n;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
