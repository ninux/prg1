Write a signature for a method named average that has two parameters, both of 
type int, and returns an int value.\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.35}
Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or class? If it is
a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.\\

The book is definitely an object, because it's a specific thing and in no way 
generic. The class could have a name like \lstinline{SchoolBook}, 
\lstinline{CodingBook} or just \lstinline{Book}.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.36}
Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.\\

No it can't.
