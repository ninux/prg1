\subsection{Start with Eclipse}
In the first chapter we've worked with the BlueJ IDE but now I want to check
Java-Coding with a common and popular Java-IDE like Eclipse
To get the BlueJ-Projects work with Eclipse there are some things that have to
be done.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new project in Eclipse.
\item Import the source (BlueJ example-code).
\item Add a package-name to the source.
\item Create a main (replaces all interaction which were invoked by hand).
\end{enumerate}
